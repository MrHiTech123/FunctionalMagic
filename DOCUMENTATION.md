## Basic Syntax

Runecraft is an entirely LL(1) language. This means that with a few exceptions, the parser automatically detects when one expression ends and the next begins, so parentheses and spaces are redundant.

It is recommended to type Runecraft using the [Runecraft Keyboard](https://github.com/MrHiTech123/RunecraftKeyboard), which is made using Keyman.


## Simple Literals
### Substances
A **substance** is a real-world material, such as wood, stone, or blood. There are six basic substances: fire, water, air, earth, mind, and flesh, which are signified by the following literals.
| Basic Substance | Literal | Key to type on keyboard |
